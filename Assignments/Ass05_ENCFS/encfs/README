PA5 - Encrypted Filesystem

This is my submission for PA5. All requirements except for encrypted write have been met.

To build:
	make all
	
To use
	./encfs <passphrase> <mirror dir> <mount dir>
	
Comments:
	- All files created in the encfs will have a user.pa5encfs.encrypted attribute set to true
		- theres no way to have a file with this attribute set to false
	- The system handles multiple openings of the same file by iterating temp file names (up to x.tmp999)
	- The system can mirror any directory
	- The system can be run in debug mode (-d) but only if its the last argument

I hit a wall trying to properly output an encrypted file. I could not figure out how to output all encrypted blocks during write time.
This has resulted in my filesystem not being able to read files it has encrypted, as decryption ALWAYS throws the improper block size error.

I've disabled encrypted read because of this in the system. Instead, it does the "pass-through" option in do_crypt(), meaning the only thing that has been disabled is the decryption step.

You are able to create and write (broken) encrypted files still, and the system handles unencrypted files without issue.
